## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DSA_preparation_python.git
   cd DSA_preparation_python
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install any dependencies:**
   Most files use only standard Python libraries, so no installation is generally required. If a file needs an external package, please refer to that file's docstring.

---

## üöÄ Usage

- Browse the `Solutions/` directory for topic-wise solutions.
- Run individual Python scripts directly:
  ```bash
  python Solutions/BinarySearch.py
  ```
- Integrate the solution classes/functions into your own project or test them with sample inputs.

**Example: Running Binary Search**
```python
from Solutions.BinarySearch import Solution

nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 7
sol = Solution()
print(sol.search(nums, target))  # Output: 3
```
